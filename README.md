# 📖 Project Overview

This project builds an enterprise-level **AI-powered Knowledge Graph system** from structured and unstructured customer support data.

The system extracts entities and relationships from support tickets, constructs a **knowledge graph**, and enables **intelligent semantic search with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** to provide automated troubleshooting responses.

---

# 🎯 Objective

To transform enterprise support ticket data into a scalable knowledge graph that enables:

- Relationship-based analysis
- Intelligent troubleshooting
- Semantic search over support tickets
- AI-assisted IT support responses

```
cleaned_tickets.xlsx
```

# ✅ Milestone 2 – Entity Extraction & Graph Construction

## Step 1: Structured Triple Extraction

Extracted **entity–relationship–entity triples** from structured columns.

Example triples:

```
Customer → RAISED → Ticket
Ticket → HAS_SEVERITY → Severity
Ticket → SUBMITTED_VIA → Channel
```

Output:

```
structured_triples.csv
```

---

## Step 2: LLM-Based NER (Ollama + Mistral)

Used the **Mistral LLM** to extract semantic relationships from ticket descriptions.

Example triples:

```
(Dell XPS, EXPERIENCING, Not turning on)
(Dell XPS, REQUIRED_ACTION, Troubleshoot power issues)
```

Output:

```
llm_triples.csv
```

---

## Step 3: Graph Construction (Neo4j)

- Combined structured and LLM-generated triples
- Inserted triples into Neo4j using the Python Neo4j driver
- Constructed graph nodes and relationships

### Graph Statistics

```
Graph Statistics (Sample Run – First 20 Rows)

Nodes: ~160+
Relationships: ~240+

Note: The above statistics correspond to a test run on the first 20 records.
Running the pipeline on the full dataset will generate a significantly larger knowledge graph.
```

---

## Step 4: Graph Validation

Validated graph integrity using Cypher queries.

### Count Nodes

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN count(n);
```

### Count Relationships

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r]->()
RETURN count(r);
```

### Visualize Graph

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN n,r,m
LIMIT 25;
```

# ✅ Milestone 3 – Semantic Search & RAG Pipeline

## Objective

Enable intelligent search and automated troubleshooting responses by integrating **semantic search** with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**.

---

## Step 1: Embedding Generation

Ticket descriptions were converted into **vector embeddings** using:

```
all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

This allows the system to understand **semantic similarity** between support tickets.

Example:

```
User Query: laptop not turning on
```

Even if a ticket says:

```
Device fails to power on
```

the system still retrieves it correctly.

---

## Step 2: Vector Database (FAISS)

Embeddings were stored in a **FAISS vector database** for fast similarity search.

Generated files:

```
vector_index.faiss
ticket_texts.pkl
```

Purpose:

| File | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| vector_index.faiss | Stores ticket embeddings |
| ticket_texts.pkl | Stores ticket descriptions mapped to vectors |

---

## Step 3: Semantic Search

User queries are converted into embeddings and matched against the FAISS index.

Example query:

```
my laptop battery drains quickly
```

Semantic search retrieves tickets discussing:

```
battery failure
power management issues
device overheating
```

even without exact keyword matches.

---

## Step 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The retrieved tickets are used as **context for the LLM**.

Pipeline:

```
User Query
      ↓
Query Embedding
      ↓
Semantic Search (FAISS)
      ↓
Retrieve Relevant Tickets
      ↓
Context Injection
      ↓
LLM Response (Ollama + Mistral)
```

---

## Example Interaction

User Query:

```
my laptop battery drains quickly
```

Generated Response:

```
1. Check battery health
2. Update power management drivers
3. Reduce background applications
4. Adjust power settings
5. Replace battery if necessary
```

---

## Final Outcome

The system now functions as an **AI-powered IT support assistant** capable of:

- Understanding natural language queries
- Performing semantic search over support tickets
- Retrieving relevant troubleshooting cases
- Generating intelligent repair recommendations using an LLM
